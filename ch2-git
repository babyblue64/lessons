Learned about the basics commands in git.
1. **git config --global**: Used to setup the configuration variables such as *user.name* and *user.email*. This is rarely used.

2. **git init**: This one is used to setup tracking of the folder/file. This is used once in a particular folder.

3. **git status**: This one will list the untracked and staged files and shows modified files. It also mentions the branch inwhich we are working.

4. **git add** : Used to stage files. Git will remember these staged files for next commitment.

5. **git commit -m** : Used to commit the staged changes. It requires a commit message.

6. **git log:** lists details of all commits in the current branch.

7. **git branch:** Lists all branches and is  also used to make new branches.

8. **git checkout:** This one's used to literally checkout earlier commits as well as switch branch heads. This is done using commit hash/branch name.

9. **git diff:** shows the changes made to files.

10. **git remote add origin SSH_URL**: Used to link local repo with remote repository on Github

11. **git push -u origin branch_name**: Used to push the current state of local repo into remote repo.
